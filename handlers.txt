Handlers in ansible are used to order tasks.
If some task is dependent on other task then we can use handler.

One approach
---
tasks:
  - name: Ensure apache is at latest version
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
    register: httpd_installation_status
  
  - name: Ensure apache is running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
      when: httpd_installation_status.changed == True
      
      
      
Second approach (Using handler)
--- 
tasks:
  - name: Ensure apache is at latest version
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
    notify:
      - Ensure Apache is Running
      - Restart

handlers:
  - name: Ensure Apache is Running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
  - name: Restart
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restart
