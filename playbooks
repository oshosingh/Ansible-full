 Why do you need Playbooks ?
 -> Ad-hoc is not good if you are running sequence of actions on clients.
 -> To execute multiple config
 
 Playbook is a YAML file, which contains multiple tasks
 Along with task, user have option to use dynamic things
  -> Variable, Files & Templates etc.
 
 Playbooks are useful for config mgmt, Deployment, Orchestration etc.
 
 Structure of Playbooks
    . Concepts
        - Tasks
        - Play
        - Playbooks
 
 Play -> combination of Tasks + targets
 Task -> Operation, user wants to perform
 
 Playbooks - combination of plays or list or sequence of plays
---
 - name: Playbook
   hosts: <group-name>
   become: yes
   become_user: root
   gather_facts: false [if you want to disable setup module call]
   tasks:
    - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
   
   run playbook = ansible-playbook -i <path of inv file> -u ec-user playbook_name.yml

-------------------------------- Executing playbooks yaml file directly ----------------------------------
1. use shebang at the top of playbook (add the full binary path prefixing with #!)
2. update ansible.cfg and add the dynamic inventiry path
3. use remote_user: ec2-user at the start of playbook if you would like to execute as user
4. give executable permission to file

# create playbook and execute playbook directly without using ansible-playbook and -i etc commands
# use --synatx-check to check syntax of playbook before executing it
# use --check to dry run
# -v to get verbose output
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Debug Module
  1. msg - print or logging statement
  2. var - variable which value user wants to print
  3. verbosity - Define verbosity of messages
  4. for printing variable use {{var_name}}
  
  debug:
   msg: "hi there"
   var: {{}}
   verbosity: 2
