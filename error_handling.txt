1. Use ignore_errors: True, if you want others task to execute even if previous tasks fail.

2. Block
   -> Blocks in Ansible allow you to logically group a set of tasks together primarily for one of two purposes.
   -> User can apply conditional logic to an entire set of tasks.
   
3. Rescure
   -> Rescue block is used for cleanUp activity in Ansible.
   -> User can use ansible block,rescue and always to perform different kinds of error handling, where the rescur
      block will be use to perform cleanup action.
      
      
   ---  (block = try, rescue = catch, always = finally)
   - block:
     - name: task 1
       command: "ls -l /root"
     
     become: yes
     ignore_errors: yes
  
     rescue: 
       - name: Rescue block (do cleanup)
         debug:
           msg: 'something went wrong cleanup'
     
     always:
       - name: always block (always execute similar to finally in java)
