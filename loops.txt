2. Loops are helpful if user wants to perform many things in one task,
   such as create a lot of users, install a lot of packages etc.
   
3. Standard loops with with_items
4. Multiple items to iterate with with_items
5. Loop over collection variable

vars:  (for point 5)
  x : ['a','b']
  y : [1,2,3,4]
  
  
tasks:  
  - name: add users in one go   (for point 3)
    user:
      name: "{{ item }}"     // reads item from with_items
      state: present
      groups: "users"
    with_items:
      - testuser1
      - testuser2
      
      
      
  - name: add several users  (for point 4)
    user:
      name: "{{ item.name }}"
      state: present
      groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
    with_items:
      - {name: "testuser3", groups: "users"}
      - {name: "testuser4", groups: "root"}
      
  - name: loop over collection of variable
    debug:
      msg: "{{ item.0 }} and {{ item.1 }}"
    with_together:
      - "{{ x }}"
      - "{{ y }}"
